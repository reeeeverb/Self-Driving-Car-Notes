# Chapter 1 - Review of Linear Algebra

## Vector Space 
- is closed under vector summation and vector multiplication
	- always remain in the space under either of these operations
- structure is commutable 
	- for every vector there exists a negative version of the vector 
	- there is also an existence of a neutral element(0)
- the 3D euclidean space is an example of a vector space

#### Subspaces 
- a subspace W of a vector space V if W is a closed vector space 
	- retain all of the properties of a vector space
- R^3 (3D Euclidean space) has a subspace that is any plane or line that goes through the origin 

#### Linear Indepedence
- once we have a set of vectors the subspace can be described by the weighted sums of these vectors 
- in a 2D subspace a position can be completely described by 2 points 
- the set S is linearly indepedent if when the result is 0 all of the coefficents of the linear combination are 0 
	- this basically checks for redundancy, all vectors should bring new information

#### Basis of V 
- a set of vectors is called a basis of V if it is linearly indepedent and spans the entire space V
- the maximal set of all vectors
- R^3 contains 3 basis(dimensions) and any point in the space can be described by the linear combinatino of the basis vectors
