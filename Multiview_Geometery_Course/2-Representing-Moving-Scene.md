# Representing a Moving Scene

#### Bound Vectors 
- given 2 points x and y, v = Y-X 
	- where v points froms point x to point y 
	- this known as a bound vector

#### Free Vectors
- a vector that is not bound to any particular point and can move around freely 
- taking away the base point from a bound vector will result in a free vector
- the set of free vectors form a linear vector space
	- this allows computation of curve length, distances, etc

#### Cross Products 
- only really existant in R3 
- if u and v are 2 vectors then the multiplication of these 2 is a vector orthagonal to u and v
	- right hand rule
