## Kinematic Models
- essentially how we choose to represent the objects in our enviornment

#### Bicycle Kinematic Model 
- simple example to start out with, 2 wheels 
- reference point can be center of gravity, center of front or rear axel
- Rear axel reference point
  - location is xr,yr
  - heading is theata 
  - length is L(between 2 axels)
  - requires 2 inputs
    - delta is the steering angle
    - velocity is v and points in the direction of each wheel
      - no slip assumption
  - omega(rotation rate) = angular velocity = velocity/Radius
