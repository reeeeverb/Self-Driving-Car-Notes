## Hardware and Software Architectures

#### Sensors  
- exterceptive record properties of the surrondings
- proprioceptive record internal properties

#### Common Sensors (Internal)
- Camera: passive light collecting sensor
  - goal is to accomplish with this alone 
  - resolution, FOV and dynamic range(lightest to darkest colors)
  - stereo cameras use at least 2 cameras to estimate depth 
- LIDAR creates 3D geometery from reflected light
  - much more universal than cameras 
  - number of beams, points per second, FOV and rotation rate 
- RADAR are very similar but use radio waves 
  - range, FOV and accuracy
  - can be wide angle with short range or vice versa 
- Sonar sensors use sound waves 
  - short range all weather 
  - used for parking 

#### Common Sensors (External)
- GPS for location, velocity and angular rotation rate
- Wheel odometry estimates the wheel rpm for speed and drift 

#### Software Stack 
- Environment Perception 
  - Identify where the ego is and where the other objects are
- Enviroment Mapping
  - Lay out the area around the car
- Motion Planning
  - Decides what actions to take
- Controller
  - takes the step to follow the planned motions 
- System Supervisor

#### Enviroment Perception 
- Localization modules takes in multiple streams of info
- outputs the vehicle position 
  - course 2
- dynamic objects 
  - tracked over time and bounding boxes
  - object motion is predicted
- static objects 
  - labeled and decided if it is neccesary to investigate
    - such as signs 

#### Enviroment Maps Module 
- Occupancy grid map 
  - all static objects around the vehicle
  - prob there is an object in an area
- Localization map
  - used by localization module to determine motion of the car 
- Detailed Road Map
  - map of road segments 
  - signs and lane markings 

#### Motion Planning Module
- Mission planner handles long term planning
  - start point to end point 
  - a more complex google maps 
- Behavior planner decides the number of safe behaviors 
  - lane changes and constraints on actions 
- Local planner is immediate and reactive
  - planned trajectory for a short period of time into the future

#### Controller 
- Velocity controller 
- Steering controller 

#### System Supervisor 
- hardware supervisor 
  - continuously monitors hardware to ensure there are no errors
  - hard stop domains for failing sensors
- software supervisor
  - analyze inconsistency in what values you get and what is to be expected
