## Perception

#### Object and Event Detection and Response (OEDR)
- perception is making sense of everything around us and the motion it is making so we can respond appropiately
- understanding patterns is difficult for computers making this task somewhat more difficult for computers 
- Goals:
  - Static Objects
    - Road and lane markings 
    - Curbs 
    - Traffic lights and signs 
    - Obstructions(cones,etc)
  - Dynamic Objects
    - Require some foresight to predict 
    - Other vehicles
    - Cyclists 
    - Pedestrians
  - Ego localization 
    - Position 
    - Velocity 
    - Orientation and angular motion
      - Course 2

#### Challenges to Perception
- Robust detection and segmentation
  - very large datasets required as there are many variables
- Sensor uncertainty
- Occlusion and reflection
- Illumination and lens flare
- Weather and rain
